'You look at what's happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.'\n\nKasich: World leaders 'just not sure' where Trump stands\nTrump appeared to be referring to recent terror attacks in Germany and elsewhere, but no such attack has occurred in Sweden. The White House did not immediately respond Sunday morning to questions about what Trump meant.\nThe official Twitter of the Embassy of Sweden in the US has responded to those asking about what happened Friday night by saying: 'Unclear to us what President Trump was referring to. Have asked US officials for explanation.'\nOthers on Twitter have speculated that Trump, who is a well-chronicled consumer of television news, might have been watching a segment on Fox News host Tucker Carlson's show Friday night.\nCarlson interviewed Ami Horowitz, a filmmaker who has tried to tie Sweden's taking in of asylum seekers to increased violent crimes in the country.\nCarl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, questioned the President's statement on Twitter.\n'Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?' Bildt tweeted. 'Questions abound.'\nTrump's remark is the latest misplaced reference to a terrorist attack or incident by those in his White House. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway inaccurately referred to a 'Bowling Green massacre' that never took place, and White House press secretary Sean Spicer referred to an attack in Atlanta, later clarifying that he meant to refer to Orlando.\nSections\nElection ResultsNationWorldOur Team\nFollow us\nCNN.com\n© 2017 Cable News Network.

Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!” Trump tweeted about the event, which is also heavily attended by celebrities.\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association, which organizes the dinner, insisted the April 29 event would still go on as planned as a “celebration of the First Amendment and the important role played by an independent news media in a healthy republic.”\n\n“We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession,” WHCA president Jeff Mason, who covers the White House for Reuters, said in a statement.\n\nThe tradition, which dates back to 1921, sees a handful of journalism students receive scholarships each year.\n\nTrump’s tweet came a day after he renewed his assault on the media by calling it “the enemy of the people,” in an ongoing battle in which he has labeled the fourth estate “fake news” and the “opposition party.”\n\nOn Friday, the White House also denied access to an off-camera briefing to several major US media outlets, including CNN, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Politico.\n\nSmaller outlets that have provided favorable coverage of the Trump administration, such as Breitbart and the One America News Network, received a green light to attend the so-called “gaggle” in White House spokesman Sean Spicer’s office.\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association said it was “protesting strongly” against the decision to deny coverage to the outlets, and would bring it up with the administration.\n\nThe New York Times described the White House decision as “an unmistakable insult to democratic ideals,” while a CNN statement called it “an unacceptable development.”\n\nIn an editorial, the Los Angeles Times warned that the incident had “ratcheted up the White House’s war on the free press” to a new level.\n\nTrump built his campaign on criticizing the mainstream US press as biased, and has intensified his rhetoric since taking office, routinely accusing the media of overstating his setbacks and downplaying his accomplishments.\n\nA week ago, at his first solo news conference, the 70-year-old launched into a long diatribe against dozens of journalists that were present, blaming their “dishonesty” for his month-old administration’s troubles.\n\nTrump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, a former head of the right-wing news site Breitbart, predicted Thursday that relations with the media — which he dubs “the opposition” — would only get worse as the president rolls out his agenda.\n\nRead More Stories About:\nBig Government\n\n  by Taboola Sponsored Links We Recommend\n15 Signs You’re Doing Well In Life Even Though You Don’t Think So\nShareAndLike\n20 Cars that are Plummeting in Value | Buzzdrives.com\nBuzzDrives\nThis Historic Photo Was Almost Lost Forever\nThe Brofessional\nDow 50,000: Too Conservative?\nStansberry Research\nNew Executive Order: Big Changes for Retirees\nMoney Morning\nWhat Jo Polniaczek Looks Like Now Is Shocking\nGoodMad\nThis Puppy Was Going To Be Euthanized.

Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!\n\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017\nThe annual gathering, hosted by the White House Correspondents Association, is usually attended by the president, reporters from media outlets that cover the White House, and celebrities.\n\nTrump’s announcement, which gave no reason, came after a sustained attack on the media. He recently called news organizations “the enemy,” and the White House on Friday excluded several major outlets, The Huffington Post among them, from a press briefing.\n\nBloomberg and Vanity Fair, which host one of the hottest parties in Washington the weekend of the annual dinner, have announced they would not hold the event this year. CNN, frequently criticized by Trump, has been contemplating sitting out the dinner.\n\nAs HuffPost’s Jason Linkins pointed out, media hand-wringing over the dinner may be a “tired genre,” as the event has long been an insular and clubby affair between newsmakers and Beltway journalists.\n\nThe annual dinner also features a roast of the president by a comedian ― something that may not have gone over with the notoriously thin-skinned Trump.\n\nJeff Mason, White House Correspondents Association president, acknowledged Trump’s announcement. “We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession,” Mason said in a statement. \n\nTrump has been stung by the event before ― in 2011, when then-President Barack Obama roasted him. At the time, Trump had been falsely claiming that Obama was not born in the United States and was pushing him to release his birth certificate.\n\nThe first White House correspondents dinner was held in 1921, and the first president to attend was Calvin Coolidge in 1924, according to the White House Correspondents’ Association website. Proceeds from the dinner go toward scholarships for aspiring journalists.\n\nDo you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?
